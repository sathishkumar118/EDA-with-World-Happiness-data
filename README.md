<h2 style="font-family:'Futura Std Condensed;">Content</h2>
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The columns such as the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia.
